# hand-gesture-controlled-virtual-keyboard
 This project is a Hand Gesture Controlled Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy. It tracks hand landmarks in real time, lets you hover over keys with your index finger, and press them using a pinch gesture with your thumb. Typed text is displayed live with a colorful animated keyboard UI.
